     * The {@code serialVersionUID} is a unique identifier for each version of a serializable class.

     * serialized object have loaded classes for that object that are compatible with each other.
     *
     * The {@code serialVersionUID} field is important for ensuring that a serialized class
     * (especially when transmitted over a network or saved to disk) can be successfully deserialized,
     * even if the class definition changes in later versions. If the {@code serialVersionUID} does not
     * match during deserialization, an {@code InvalidClassException} is thrown.
     *
     * This field is optional, but it is good practice to explicitly declare it to prevent
     * automatic generation, which could lead to compatibility issues when the class structure changes.
     *
     * The {@code @Serial} annotation is used here to indicate that this field is related to
     * serialization. This annotation is available starting from Java 14 and helps improve clarity
     * regarding the purpose of this field.
